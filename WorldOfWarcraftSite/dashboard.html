              <p>
                World of Warcraft (WoW), massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) created by the American
                company Blizzard Entertainment
                and released on November 14, 2004. Massively multiplayer refers to games in which thousands, even
                millions, of players may participate online together, typically in gaming worlds that persist indefinitely
                (with characters
                that are stored and then reactivated whenever a player rejoins). World of Warcraft,
                or WoW, is part of the Warcraft franchise, which includes Warcraft: Orcs & Humans,
                Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness, and Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos. Soon after its release,
                the game enjoyed a period of tremendous success and popularity among gamers worldwide.
              </p>
  
              
              <h4><strong>Development throughout the years</strong></h4>
              <p>
              Since launch, World of Warcraft has had eight major expansion packs: The Burning Crusade (2007),
              Wrath of the Lich King (2008), Cataclysm (2010), Mists of Pandaria (2012), Warlords of Draenor (2014),
              Legion (2016), Battle for Azeroth (2018), and Shadowlands (2020), with a ninth, Dragonflight,
              currently in development.

                <p>
                  Released in 2004, World of Warcraft has gone from the bedroom fantasy of Warcraft III fans –
                  living out their dreams in the expanse of Azeroth – to becoming a worldwide phenomenon that has
                  tood the test of time as the most popular massively multiplayer online game in the world.
  
                  In 2019, World of Warcraft is still the king of the MMO scene. Having fended off countless attempts
                  to claim
                  its throne, it has held strong and soldiered on. While it hasn’t always been smooth sailing, and
                  the game is certainly not as it was during the height of its fame, it continues to maintain substantial
                  cultural relevance.
  
                  When it comes to esports, 2019 may well be one of the most important years in the history of the game.
                  With
                  World of Warcraft now enjoying its 15th year, its competitive scene continues to grow. With improving
                  prize
                  pools funded by the community, the future looks bright.
  
                  That’s where this series of articles comes in. We’ll take a look at the three key aspects of the title’s
                  esports efforts: the past, the present, and the future, and what it all means.

              <h4 class="mb-6" style="text-align:center"><strong>The foundation of something great, forged on a
                  battlefield of
                  blood</strong></h4>
  
              <div class="mb-6">
                <p>
                  One thing that’s important to note about World of Warcraft is that when it launched back in 2004, it
                  lacked a true ‘player vs. player’ aspect. Sure, players could kill each other – and they frequently did
                  –
                  but it was largely just to be annoying or to make their own fun.
  
                  The actual idea of PvP would not come to World of Warcraft until patch 1.4, nearly six months after the
                  game’s US release, when Blizzard added a PvP Honour System. Sure, Blizzard added the Gurubashi Arena in
                  December 2004’s patch 1.2 which gave players a reason to participate in PvP, but the introduction of an
                  actual ranked system gave players something to look forward to. Thankfully for PvP players, the wait for
                  the next addition was short-lived.
  
                  Patch 1.5’s introduction of Battlegrounds gave fans not only a reason to fight, but also a place to do
                  it
                  too. Players in groups of 10 for Warsong Gulch (Capture the Flag) and 40 for Alterac Valley (a large
                  scale
                  PvP/PvE hybrid) would do battle against the opposition faction. At the end of each week, players would
                  earn a rank based on the number of honour points they’d accrued in comparison to other members of their
                  faction, with the highest ranks obtaining specific PvP armour, mounts, and weapons.

                <p>
                  In 2007, Blizzard embraced esports at its annual fan expo, BlizzCon, in the form of three vs. three
                  arena.
                  This started a trend that has continued ever since, with Blizzard adding more events over multiple days
                  –
                  including events in the build-up to BlizzCon. The expo became the final event in the World of Warcraft
                  esports calendar, as it had for Warcraft III and StarCraft. During 2007’s BlizzCon, Blizzard put $40,000
                  (£32,000) up for the finalist, and the competition in the end was won by MoB Turtle Beach.
                  During the period of 2010-2013, Blizzard would do something a little different when it came to BlizzCon.
                  2010 brought the first attempt to bring the raid experience to BlizzCon as Blizzard brought #1 guild
                  Paragon on stage to fight against a number of bosses from past raids. The series of boss waves took
                  place
                  outside the Horde city of Orgrimmar, with a live audience cheering them on alongside a team providing a
                  running commentary on events. It was an interesting idea and one that Blizzard would return to the
                  following year in a more refined and competitive format.
                  2011 saw what was truly our first glimpse at the Race to World First, we just didn’t know it at the
                  time.
                  Two guilds – Blood Legion and Vodka – would go head-to-head on stage in a race to finish the Firelands
                  25-man raid first. Blizzard would repeat the event in 2013 where Method would take on Midwinter. The
                  above
                  clip shows the start of something different in World of Warcraft esports, but it wasn’t to be. Blizzard
                  would not bring the format back at subsequent BlizzCon iterations.
                  Welcome to the Mythic Dungeon Invitational (MDI), World of Warcraft esports’ second pillar. With the
                  release of World of Warcraft: Legion, Blizzard changed one of the staples of WoW: the dungeon system
                  received a new mode. These more challenging versions would see players acquiring keys to make the
                  dungeon
                  more difficult, with ‘affixes’ (see: debuffs) being applied as players took their key past certain
                  thresholds, with a maximum of four affixes active once you reach level 10.
  
                  Players would race to finish the objectives before a timer expired and be awarded loot based on speed,
                  with teams who complete the keystone in time receiving a new key for another dungeon at a higher level.
                  These affixes would add a range of things, from increasing the density of mobs in a pack, spawning pools
                  of healing blood when an enemy was killed to ones that caused mobs to enrage when hitting 20 percent HP.
  
                  In 2017 and 2018, Blizzard brought the MDI to BlizzCon. The best teams from Europe, China, Asia-Pacific,
                  and the Americas would head to BlizzCon to battle on stage to become the MDI champions. Both on-stage
                  teams would fight through the same dungeon with the same affix combination, using whatever five-man
                  composition they wished (with rules applied to changes post-game). The winner was the team who killed
                  the
                  last boss & achieve a 100 percent clear completion percentage, awarded for killing a certain number of
                  non-boss mobs in a dungeon. MDI was focused less on the PvP side of esports, rather occupying the ‘games
                  done quick’ or ‘speedrunning’ aspect of other titles. While MDI was not for everyone, it always felt
                  like
                  a more natural fit for World of Warcraft, a game that at its core is a PvE experience.
